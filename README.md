# Pathway Finder

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict career recommendations for high school students according to their interests, grades, extracurriculars, personality traits and favorite subjects.

## Problem statement

In Rwanda, high school students face significant challenges due to an inadequate career guidance system. This issue has led to limited career exploration, with students not being able to follow their passions because they are often not aware of what career options are available. A lot of students ask themselves, ‘what now?’ when they finish high school as they are rarely sure how to proceed.

## Dataset

To create the classification models, [dataset]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VXHjV4Hi7d__I9v2KYudh32OVud3aEvm/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XC-gWLDLPuGyY9sepqH1tSXfd3Jm7aiJ/view?usp=sharing)) was used. The dataset was initially sourced from Kaggle and went through pre-processing and modifications to align with the project. The dataset contains 9 columns of data with variables or parameters that help in predicting student career paths. The target variable is the recommended career, which is a multiclass classification.
